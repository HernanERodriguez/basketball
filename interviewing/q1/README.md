# NBA Hornets Analytics Quiz

1. Last year the Celtics finished with the 5th worst record in the NBA. Whether itâ€™s two years from now or twenty years from now, what pick are the Celtics more likely to land first, the #1 pick or the #5 pick? Assume that the lottery odds and structure remain the same going forward. Further assume that the Celtics are likely to improve and every year the team will either:
  1. Improve by 3 positions (e.g. they go from 5th worst to 8th worst) with a probability of 0.6
  2. OR fall 2 positions (e.g. they go from 5th worst to 3rd worst) with a probability of 0.4.
