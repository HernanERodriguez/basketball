A note that might be of interest - I geocoded all of the NCAA teams
and added a factor into my model accounting for distance traveled
by each team. The impact was surprisingly significant and jumped
the predictive power of my model nearly a full percentage point;
at this level, that's a very large improvement. This is additional
to the home court advantage that's already in the model.
